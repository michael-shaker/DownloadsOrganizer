Downloads Organizer
===================

Simple scripts to move files from a source folder (e.g., Downloads) into categories: Pictures, Music, Video, Documents, and Misc.

Quick start
-----------

- Edit `source_path` and `destination_base_path` in `DownloadsOrganizerv5.py` (recommended).
- Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\flyin\Documents\GitHub\DownloadsOrganizer
python .\DownloadsOrganizerv5.py
```

Notes
-----

- Requires Python 3.7+; uses only the standard library (`os`, `shutil`).
- The scripts move files (not copy). Back up important files first.

Location
--------

`c:\YOURPATH\DownloadsOrganizer\README.md`
1. Edit the `source_path` and `destination_base_path` variables at the bottom of the script you want to run (for example, `DownloadsOrganizerv5.py`) to match your environment.
